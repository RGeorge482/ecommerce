This is a small e-commerce website, where on the main page users have the possibility to choose from the list of products and to add them to the cart. 
At the next step in the cart, they will see the number of items, the total amount together with the list of chosen products. From here they can 
proceed to checkout where they have to fill the shipping information form and they will be redirected to the PayPal payment method. This web application 
consists of Python(Django), JavaScript code for the backend, and HTML/CSS for the frontend.
